# Bash-Script-Revision

## Purpose 
This repository is set up to store what I have learnt about Bash scripts. Instead of 
making it as another Bash script cheatsheet, I try to come up with scenarios
that you might use Bash and attach my answer for the tasks  

## Content
1. Merry Christmas (MerryChristmas) - Take user's input and say Merry Christmas to the user! 
2. Automate the flow of data (HandleData)
    - Combine multiple CSVs (probably from different processes in parallel programming) to a single CSV 
    - Perform simple calculation actions on
3. GNU parallel (GNUParallel) - Run the executable with multiple processes 

Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas or if you want to contribute to this repository as well!
