# Bash-Script-Revision

## Purpose 
This repository is set up to store what I have learnt about Bash script. Instead of 
making it another as another Bash script cheatsheet, I try to come up with some scenario
that you might use Bash and attach my answer for the tasks  

## Content (Directory) 
1. Merry Christmas (MerryChristmas) - Take user's input and say Merry Christmas to the user ! 
2. Automate the flow of data (HandleData)
    - Combine multiple csv (probably from different processes in parallel programming) to a single csv 
    - Perform simple calculation actions on
3. GNU parallel (GNUParallel) - Run the executible with multiple processes 

Feel free to contact me if you have any idea / if you want to contribute to this repository as well !
