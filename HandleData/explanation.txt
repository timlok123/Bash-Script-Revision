You are now given the csv where their names have the following format:

sum_<starting integer>_<ending integer>.csv

These csv records the sum of integers from <starting integer> to <ending integer>. 
Try to combine the data in different csv to a new csv with name sum_combined.csv with
the same headers in each of the csv and calculate the final sum. Store it as the last 
of the combined csv and output it after the combination of csv.
